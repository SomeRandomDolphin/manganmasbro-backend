      "Make the caramel sauce. Add 2 tablespoons water and the sugar in a small saucepan. Swirl it just a bit until all the sugar looks wet. Set it over medium heat, and cook without stirring until the mixture bubbles vigorously and turns from pale to light brown, then amber to dark amber. It should look glossy and smooth, not grainy. This takes 4 to 6 minutes, depending on the strength of your stove. If crystals start to form in the caramel, it's best to start over. There's no way to fix this. In the meantime, have an 8x2-inch round cake pan and a kitchen towel ready. Carefully pour the caramel into the cake pan and working quickly tilt the pan to swirl and coat the bottom and sides. Hold on to the sides with a kitchen towel—there is nothing more painful than molten sugar. Set the pan aside.",
    step_3:
      "Make the custard. In a 4-cup measuring cup or medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks, whole egg, and sweetened condensed milk until fully combined. Whisk in the heavy cream, vanilla, and salt. The custard should be smooth and thoroughly combined, but try not to whisk it vigorously, creating too many bubbles.",
    step_4:
      "Prepare the water bath. Pour the custard through a  fine mesh strainer over the caramel in the pan. Place the pan into an oven-safe vessel large enough to hold it—a roasting pan, baking dish, or shallow braiser with straight sides, and place it in the oven. Pour the boiling water into the roasting dish until it comes about halfway up the sides of the cake pan.",
    step_5:
      "Bake the flan. Bake the flan until the top is set and no longer wet, but a little jiggly when you gently nudge the cake pan, about 1 hour 20 minutes.",
    step_6:
      "Chill the flan. Carefully remove the cake pan from the water bath (use a kitchen towel) and let it cool for about 1 hour on the kitchen counter. Tightly cover the pan with plastic wrap, making sure it doesn’t touch the top of the flan. Chill in the fridge for at least 6 hours or overnight.",
    step_7:
      "Serve the flan. When ready to serve (flan should be served cold), run a small knife around the edges to loosen the flan. Flip a large, deep plate upside down on top of the cake pan. In one swift movement, invert the cake pan and plate. Give the bottom of the cake pan a couple of firm taps to help release the flan onto the plate. Gently lift the cake pan and marvel at your work of art. It’s okay if some caramel is still stuck to the cake pan. Soak it in water for a few minutes, and it’ll melt off. Keep leftovers refrigerated for up to 4 days, tightly covered.",

      "Make the meatball mixture. Stir the cooled onions into the milk bread mixture. Add the egg, ground beef and pork, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cardamom. Use your (clean) hands to mix everything together until well combined. (If you have extra time, chilling the mixture for 20 or so minutes will make it easier to roll out the meatballs.)",
    step_4:
      "Form the meatballs: Use your hands to form the mixture into meatballs about 1 1/4-inch to 1 1/2-inch wide and place them on a plate or sheet pan. This recipe should make about 40 meatballs. Note that the meatballs will be a bit on the wet side.",
    step_5:
      "Brown the meatballs on all sides: Heat 3 tablespoons of butter in a large sauté pan on medium heat. When the butter is melted and foamy, start adding some meatballs to the pan. Working in batches as to not crowd the pan, slowly brown the meatballs on all sides. Use a wooden spoon or tongs to turn them. Handle the meatballs gently so they do not break apart as you turn them. Once the meatballs have browned on all sides and are just cooked through, remove them from the pan to a bowl. You'll warm the meatballs in the sauce later. Once you have removed the meatballs from the pan, wipe out the butter and blackened bits with a paper towel. We'll want to start with fresh butter so we don't pick up any burnt bits from the pan. This way, we will be able to more accurately gauge the amount of fat in the pan for making the meatball sauce in the next step.",

Stir until smooth. Continue to stir, allowing the flour mixture to cook, several minutes, until the roux is the color of coffee with cream.",
    step_7:
      "Add stock to make the sauce: When the roux has cooked to a lovely shade of light brown, slowly add the stock, stirring as you do. The stock will sputter at first and the roux may seize up, but keep adding the stock slowly and keep stirring. Eventually the sauce will loosen and become silky.",

To use this method, place both skillets (one on top of the other) over medium heat and let them heat through. If using a panini press set it to medium heat. The skillet or griddle shouldn’t be screaming hot, but it should radiate enough heat to toast the bread slowly. If you aren’t using the double pan method or a panini press, just use anything you have to weigh the sandwich down – a foil wrapped brick, your spatula, whatever you have will do.",

If you’re using a skillet, you may have to cut the loaf cut the loaf vertically as well so it fits in your pan and make the sandwich in batches.

If using the 2-skillet method, once both pans are heated through, lift the top pan up. Place the sandwich into the bottom pan and place the top pan directly onto the sandwich. Otherwise, weight the sandwich down using your preferred method. Grill the Cubano for 5-6 minutes on one side before carefully flipping the sandwich and grilling for another 5-6 minutes on the other side. If you’re using a panini press, grill for 6 minutes total, or until the cheese is melted. When ready the Cubano should have a flat, crispy, slightly dark brown, top and bottom, and the cheese should be melted.",

Cook for 7-10 minutes on medium-high heat while moving them around until the onions turn golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to take the onions out of the oil and spread into the paper-towel-lined plate or sheet pan lined to soak up the excess oil. Set aside for later. You will use these onions to make a paste. Leave about 1 tablespoon of oil in the pot and discard the rest.",

    step_1:
      "Preheat the oven and prepare a baking sheet: Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the upper third of the oven. Place the butter on a rimmed baking sheet and place in the preheated oven until the butter melts, about 5 minutes.",
    step_2:
      "Assemble the sandwiches and bake: Spread goat cheese evenly on 5 of the bread slices. Carefully tilt the pan so the melted butter coats the bottom. Arrange all of the bread slices in a single layer in the melted butter on the baking sheet. Ensure the goat cheese is facing up. Place 1 cheddar slice on each bread slice with goat cheese and place 1 slice each of provolone and 1 slice of Swiss on each plain bread slice.",
    step_3:
      "Bake: Return to the oven and bake at 425°F until the cheese is bubbly and the bread is beginning to brown, about 7 minutes.",
    step_4:
      "Assemble sandwiches and return to the oven: Remove from the oven and assemble the sandwiches by combining each of the goat cheese slices with the provolone and Swiss slices. Return to oven and bake until bread is golden and toasted, 3 to 4 minutes.",
